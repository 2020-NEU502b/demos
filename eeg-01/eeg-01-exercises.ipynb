Oculomotor activity causes large deflections in the EEG recording (with decreasing magnitude as channels are further from the eyes). \n",

ICA finds directions in the feature space corresponding to projections with high non-Gaussianity. We thus obtain a decomposition into independent components, and the artifactâ€™s contribution is typically localized in only a small number of components. These components have to be correctly identified and removed.\n",
