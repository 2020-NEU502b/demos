In this demo, we'll build up from linear regression to logistic regression to a simple 2-layer neural network. We'll also study a network that's learned Rumelhart's semantic network.

To run the code in this demo, you'll need to install PyTorch:
```
pip install torch
```

The interface to PyTorch is very similar to that of Numpy with some subtle differences. The [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) is very thorough. There are a few cheat sheets online ([showing common operators](https://www.simonwenkel.com/publications/cheatsheets/pdf/cheatsheet_pytorch_numpy_like_functions.pdf), [comparing to numpy](https://github.com/myazdani/numpy-pytorch-cheatsheet)) that might help with getting up to speed on differences.
